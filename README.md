## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture for a SaaS platform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), text-to-SQL capabilities, and Xero accounting data. The architecture prioritizes data sensitivity and isolation, ensuring that each client's data and compute resources are segregated to meet high-security requirements.

## Overview of Requirements

- **User Management**: Users can sign up and authenticate securely.
- **Xero Integration**: Users can connect their Xero accounts via OAuth 2.0.
- **Per-Client Resource Isolation**: Each client has isolated storage, compute, and data resources.
- **Data Ingestion and Transformation**: Fetch and process Xero data per client.
- **LLM Access**: Provide an LLM interface for users to query their data.
- **Scalability**: Support from 0 to 10,000 clients efficiently.
- **Security**: Ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations.
- **Error Handling**: Isolate errors to prevent cascading failures.

## High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture Diagram](https://example.com/architecture-diagram.png) *(Note: Replace with an actual diagram in implementation)*

The architecture consists of several layers, each responsible for specific functionalities:

1. **User Interface and Authentication**: Built with Next.js and Firebase.
2. **Xero Integration**: Handles OAuth 2.0 authentication and token management.
3. **Resource Provisioning**: Automates creation of per-client resources.
4. **Data Pipelines**: Ingestion and transformation of data using per-client compute instances.
5. **LLM Service**: Provides natural language querying capabilities via LangChain.
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Tracks system performance and errors.
7. **Security Layer**: Enforces data isolation and compliance.

## Components and Workflow

### 1. User Interface and Authentication

**Technologies Used**: Next.js, Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore

**Functionality**:

- **Frontend Application**: Developed using Next.js for server-side rendering and performance.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Users sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication.
  - Supports email/password and third-party providers if needed.
- **User Data Storage**:
  - Store user profiles and metadata in Cloud Firestore.
  - Track onboarding progress and preferences.

**Workflow**:

1. **Sign-Up/Login**: Users access the platform and authenticate via Firebase.
2. **Dashboard Access**: Authenticated users access their dashboard to manage integrations and data.

### 2. Xero OAuth 2.0 Integration

**Technologies Used**: Xero API, Secret Manager, Cloud Functions

**Functionality**:

- **OAuth 2.0 Flow**:
  - Users initiate the connection to their Xero account.
  - The platform handles the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow.
- **Token Management**:
  - Access and refresh tokens are securely stored.
  - Tokens are stored in Secret Manager under a unique secret per client.

**Workflow**:

1. **Initiate Connection**: User clicks "Connect to Xero" in the dashboard.
2. **Authorization Flow**:
   - Redirected to Xero's consent page.
   - Upon consent, redirected back with an authorization code.
3. **Token Exchange**:
   - Backend exchanges the code for access and refresh tokens.
   - Tokens are stored securely in Secret Manager (`xero_token_{client_id}`).
4. **Confirmation**: User is notified of successful connection.

### 3. Per-Client Resource Provisioning

**Technologies Used**: Cloud Functions, Terraform, Service Accounts, IAM

**Functionality**:

- **Resource Creation**:
  - **Cloud Storage Bucket**: `client-{client_id}-bucket`
  - **BigQuery Datasets**:
    - Raw Data: `raw_{client_id}`
    - Transformed Data: `transformed_{client_id}`
  - **Service Account**: `client-{client_id}-sa`
- **Automation**:
  - Triggered upon successful Xero integration.
  - Uses Terraform scripts or GCP APIs for resource provisioning.

**Workflow**:

1. **Provisioning Trigger**: Post Xero authorization, a Cloud Function is triggered.
2. **Resource Creation**:
   - Resources are created using Terraform or GCP APIs.
   - IAM policies are set to restrict access to the client's service account.
3. **Confirmation**: Provisioning status is updated in Firestore.

### 4. Data Ingestion Pipeline

**Technologies Used**: Cloud Run Jobs, Cloud Scheduler, Secret Manager

**Functionality**:

- **Per-Client Data Ingestion**:
  - Each client has a dedicated Cloud Run Job for data ingestion.
  - Jobs are triggered manually by the client or scheduled.
- **Data Fetching**:
  - Fetch data from Xero using stored OAuth tokens.
- **Data Storage**:
  - Store raw data in the client's Cloud Storage bucket.

**Workflow**:

1. **Job Triggering**:
   - Client initiates data refresh via the dashboard.
   - Alternatively, jobs are scheduled using Cloud Scheduler.
2. **Data Fetching**:
   - Cloud Run Job authenticates using the client's service account.
   - Retrieves OAuth token from Secret Manager.
   - Fetches data from Xero APIs.
3. **Data Storage**:
   - Stores data in `gs://client-{client_id}-bucket/raw/`.

### 5. Data Transformation Pipeline

**Technologies Used**: Cloud Run Jobs, dbt (Data Build Tool), BigQuery

**Functionality**:

- **Per-Client Data Transformation**:
  - Each client has a dedicated Cloud Run Job for data transformation.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Runs dbt models to clean and normalize data.
- **Data Storage**:
  - Writes transformed data to the client's BigQuery dataset.

**Workflow**:

1. **Job Triggering**:
   - Triggered after successful data ingestion.
   - Can be orchestrated using Cloud Pub/Sub messages.
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Cloud Run Job reads raw data from the client's bucket.
   - Runs dbt models to process data.
3. **Data Loading**:
   - Loads transformed data into `transformed_{client_id}` dataset in BigQuery.

### 6. LLM Integration with LangChain

**Technologies Used**: Cloud Run, LangChain, BigQuery

**Functionality**:

- **LLM Service**:
  - A shared Cloud Run service using LangChain to interpret user queries.
- **Data Access Control**:
  - The service uses the client's service account to query their data.
- **Natural Language Interface**:
  - Users input queries in natural language.
  - LLM generates and executes SQL queries on the client's dataset.

**Workflow**:

1. **User Query**:
   - User submits a question via the dashboard.
2. **LLM Processing**:
   - LLM service receives the query and authenticates the user.
   - Uses LangChain to convert the query into a SQL statement.
3. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Executes the SQL query against `transformed_{client_id}` dataset.
   - Retrieves results securely.
4. **Response Delivery**:
   - Results are returned to the user in the dashboard.

### 7. Error Handling and Monitoring

**Technologies Used**: Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Alerts

**Functionality**:

- **Error Isolation**:
  - Errors in one client's jobs do not affect others.
- **Logging**:
  - All jobs and services log events with client identifiers.
- **Monitoring Dashboards**:
  - Centralized dashboards display job statuses and system health.
- **Alerts**:
  - Configurable alerts for failures or performance issues.

**Workflow**:

1. **Error Detection**:
   - Jobs emit logs and metrics during execution.
2. **Alerting**:
   - Alerts are triggered based on predefined conditions.
   - Notifications are sent to administrators or support teams.
3. **Error Resolution**:
   - Support teams can identify issues using logs tagged with `client_id`.
   - Errors are addressed without impacting other clients.

### 8. Security and Compliance

**Technologies Used**: IAM, Secret Manager, VPC Service Controls, Cloud Audit Logs

**Functionality**:

- **Data Isolation**:
  - Each client's data is stored in separate buckets and datasets.
- **Access Control**:
  - Dedicated service accounts per client with least privilege.
- **Encryption**:
  - Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Compliance**:
  - Meets requirements for data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

**Security Measures**:

- **IAM Policies**:
  - Fine-grained permissions assigned to service accounts.
- **Secret Management**:
  - OAuth tokens stored securely with access restricted to the client's resources.
- **Network Security**:
  - Use VPC Service Controls to define security perimeters.
